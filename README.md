## Objective 
Very cool little finger algorithm to mutiply some numbers.

## How it works

1.let s say i wnat to multiply to number(single digits ) from 6 -10 
2. I use my fingers to represent each number in one hand ...with following mapping:
thumb - 6
Index - 7
 middle  -8
 ringer - 9
 pinky - 10
 
 3. join all the fingers that reprent the 2 numbers being mutiplied 
 4. then count how many fingers there are joined .... x 10
 5. lastly count roaming fingers from left hand and mutiply by roaming fingers in right hand.
 6. final step: add step #4 with #5
